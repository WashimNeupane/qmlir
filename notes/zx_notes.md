What I don't understand about ZX
--------------------------------
1. How are the diagrams graphs? Doesn't the order matter? Won't gates become adjoint-ed when the circuit is reversed?
1. Can we represent symbolic values (angles etc.) in pyzx?


What we could do
----------------
1. Use it to check equivalence - use ZX to simplify
1. Use ZX to optimize
